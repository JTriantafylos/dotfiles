# dotfiles

User configuration files (dotfiles) for my personal [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) systems. Some short utility shell scripts I have written are also included.

This repository is mostly to maintain a backup and easily distribute my dotfiles, though anyone is free to use these as they please if they like my configurations.
