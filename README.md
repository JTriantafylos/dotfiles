# JTriantafylos dotfiles

User configuration files (dotfiles) for my personal [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) systems. Some short utility shell scripts I have written are also included.

This repository is mainly to maintain a backup and easily distribute my dotfiles between systems, though anyone is free to use these for their own system.

The dotfiles are structured such that they can be *installed* and *uninstalled* with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). See `stow(8)` for usage details
